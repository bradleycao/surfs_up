# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Project

In this project, I helped a client get more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, the client wants temperature data for June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

- The temperature between the two months **is not vastly different**. The mean is 75 in June and 71 in December (2 degrees differences), and the standard deviation is similar too, with 3.25 in June and 3.74 in December.

- The **total amount of observation points** in December is less than in June with 1700 and 1517 respectively (183 points difference) 

- The **Min temperature** is the most significant difference between the two months, with 64 degrees in June and 56 degrees in December (8 degrees difference).

## Summary:

Overall, I think it is feasible to open the surf and ice cream shop business year-round since the temperatures between the two June and December are not vastly different. They have similar Average, Max, Min, and Standard Deviation indexes.

Furthermore, I created two more queries/plots to display additional information about the weather in June and December in Oahu:

- The first one is to see the Average Temperature of June and December only throughout the year. From this query, we can see that, on average, the temperature was rising throughout the year and did not have significant differences between the two months. The exception was in December of 2014 where the Average Temps drop to around 70 degrees, but then it bounced back. 

- The second one is to see the Average Precipitation of June and December only throughout the year. Surprisingly, in this location, December had more rain than in June on average, but again, there were no significant differences in precipitation between the two months.
